A couple of the projects done as part of the course [CS6401: Software Engineering](https://karthikv1392.github.io/cs6401_se/).

## Contents

The corresponding code and reports have been added as subdirectories with their commits squashed into this repository's main branch.

The following summaries have been generated by ChatGPT to showcase the objectives of each.

### Project 1

- Analyzed and refactored an existing web-based book management app.
- Identified and addressed design smells using automated tools like Sonarqube.
- Documented system functionality, class behaviors, and relationships using UML diagrams.
- Conducted comprehensive code metrics analysis to assess software quality and maintainability.
- Improved codebase maintainability and readability through systematic refactoring.
- Gained practical experience in applying software engineering principles to real-world projects.

### Automated Refactoring

- Developed a script to periodically scan the GitHub repository for design smells. Utilize the capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) to assist in identifying potential design issues in the codebase.
- Automated refactoring and pull request generation using GitHub workflows.
